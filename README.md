# My To-Do List Application

This was an awesome proyect that got me engaged the entire time. This is my To-Do Application, an application that allows the user to create, modify and delete everyday tasks. The backend application was made with Java using the Spring-Boot framework. This was my first time using this framwork , so it took a bit more effort than expected. The freamework was very useful for this application. It simplified all the API structure.
For the frontend application I used the React library. It was alse the first time I used React on a JS application and now I can understan why it one of the most common libraries to use in frontend applciations, it was very easy to use and very powerfull aswell. I combiend it with the Material UI library for visual enhancement in the application.

## Future Steps

The entire application was planned in two phases. The first one includes the creation, modification, and delete of tasks.  The task can be checked as completed. All the information is saved on a Database.

The second phase includes the incorporation of folders where the task can be stored. The user can remove and edit the folder and the task within.

A third optional phase includes a login screen.

UI can be improved by a lot, but it looks childish and I kind of like it :D 


# How to use

In order to use this application we will have to do the following steps:

1. Install Docker https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
2. Install WSL 2: On the Desktop Docker Installer is the WSL2 Intaller is included. You can also run 
wsl --install on PowerShell (only Windows)
3. Go to "ToDoList" directory and execute the following command:
 ```
 docker-compose up
 ```
4. Once all the containers are built go to http://localhost:3000/
5. Enjoy the useful To-Do-List Application!
